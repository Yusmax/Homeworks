                When we fall victim to Black and White Thinking, we have mistakenly reduced an entire spectrum of possibilities down to the two most extreme options. Each is the polar opposite of the other without any shades of gray in between. Often, those categories are of our own creation. We attempt to force the world to conform to our preconceptions about what it should look like.

As an all-too-common example: many people insist that whoever is not "with" us must be "against" us. They can then justifiably be treated as an enemy.

This dichotomy assumes that there are only two possible categories -- with us and against us -- and that everything and everyone must belong to either the former or the latter. Possible shades of gray, like agreeing with our principles but not our methods, are ignored entirely.

Of course, we should not make the analogous mistake of assuming that such dichotomies are never valid. Simple propositions can often be categorized as true or false.

For example, people can be divided into those who are capable of performing a task and those who currently cannot do so. Although many similar situations can be found, they are not usually the subject of debate.
